Pod: refers to one or more containers that should be controlled as a single 
     application. A pod encapsulates application containers, storage resources,
     a unique network ID and other configuration on how to run the containers
    
Node: is a worker machine in kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical
      machine, depending on the cluster. Each node is managed by the control plane
      A node can have multiple pods, and the kubernetes control plane automatically
      handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the cluster

Cluster: is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Kubernetes
         clusters allow containers to run across multiple machines and 
         environments: virtual, physical, cloud-based and on-promises.
         Kubernetes containers are not restricted to a specific operating
         system, unlike virtual machines. Instead, they are able to share
         operating systems and run anywhere
